# Multi-Agent System Architecture: Initial Concepts

This document outlines the initial architectural considerations for the Tax Analysis Multi-Agent System.

## 1. Agent Roles (Preliminary)

We envision a system composed of specialized agents, each responsible for specific tasks. Initial thoughts on agent roles include:

*   **DataIngestionAgent:** Responsible for collecting, validating, and storing incoming tax filing data from various sources.
*   **DataProcessingAgent:** Handles pre-processing of data, cleaning, transformation, and ensuring it's ready for analysis.
*   **TrendAnalysisAgent:** Analyzes data to identify short-term and long-term trends in tax filings. Could be further specialized (e.g., ShortTermTrendAgent, LongTermTrendAgent).
*   **PredictionAgent (ML):** Utilizes machine learning models to forecast future tax filing behaviors and trends.
*   **FactorIdentificationAgent (ML):** Employs ML and statistical methods to identify key factors influencing tax filing patterns.
*   **InsightGeneratorAgent:** Synthesizes findings from various analytical agents to produce actionable insights and recommendations.
*   **PolicySimulationAgent:** Allows users to simulate the potential impact of new policies on tax filing behavior.
*   **VisualizationReportingAgent:** Gathers data and prepares it for visualization, or directly generates reports/dashboards.
*   **OrchestrationAgent (Optional):** Manages the workflow and communication between other agents, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order.

## 2. Communication Mechanisms

Agents will need to communicate effectively. Potential mechanisms include:

*   **Message Queues:** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) For asynchronous communication, decoupling agents, and ensuring resilient message delivery. This is suitable for event-driven interactions.
*   **Direct API Calls (REST/gRPC):** For synchronous request/response interactions where an immediate answer is needed.
*   **Shared Database/Data Lake:** Agents can share data through a common data store, though this requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency.

A hybrid approach might be most effective.

## 3. Technology Stack Considerations (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Primary Language:** Python (due to its strong ecosystem for data science, ML, and web frameworks).
*   **Data Handling/Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Dask (for larger datasets).
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
*   **Agent Framework (Optional):** Consider frameworks like `agentpy`, `mesa`, or building custom agent abstractions.
*   **Web Framework (for APIs/UI):** Flask, FastAPI, Django.
*   **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ, Kafka.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a data lake solution depending on data characteristics and query patterns.
*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Dash, or a dedicated BI tool.

## 4. Data Flow (Conceptual)

1.  **DataIngestionAgent** collects data.
2.  Data is passed to **DataProcessingAgent** for cleaning.
3.  Processed data is made available (e.g., via message queue or database).
4.  **TrendAnalysisAgent**, **PredictionAgent**, **FactorIdentificationAgent** consume processed data.
5.  Outputs from these analytical agents are consumed by **InsightGeneratorAgent** and **PolicySimulationAgent**.
6.  **VisualizationReportingAgent** uses data from various stages to create visualizations.

Further refinement of these concepts will occur as the project progresses.
